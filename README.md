# Discrete-Structures-and-Algorithms
This repository contains a collection of Java programs developed during my Data Structure course. All implementations rely on user-defined functions.

# What will you learn in this repository?
In exploring this repository, learners can gain hands-on experience in implementing algorithms, understanding their inner workings, and applying them to real-world scenarios. Whether you are a student seeking to reinforce your understanding of discrete structures and algorithms or a curious mind eager to explore the intricacies of problem-solving, these projects offer a valuable resource for learning and discovery.

## Calculator GUI
__Description:__ A graphical user interface (GUI) calculator that implements the MDAS rule (Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction).

__Algorithm used:__
- Shift and subtraction algorithm for division
- Recursion method for subtraction and addition
- Russian Peasant Method for multiplication
  
__Features:__
- The program displays the step-by-step solution for each computation, providing insights into how different algorithms work.
- Stack data structure is utilized to enhance the calculator's functionality.
